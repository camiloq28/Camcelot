🧭 Plan Management Specification (for Replit Assistant)

📌 Goal
Create a robust Plan Management UI where an admin can:
1. Create/Edit/Delete Plans
2. For each plan:
   - Select allowed integrations
   - Choose specific triggers and actions from those integrations
3. Store this configuration in a structured way that allows it to:
   - Power the client’s workflow builder
   - Respect plan and connection limitations

📁 Integration Metadata
Source: GET /api/integrations/meta

Shape:
{
  "actionsByIntegration": {
    "greenhouse": {
      "actions": [
        { "key": "create_candidate", "label": "Create Candidate", "fields": [...] }
      ]
    },
    ...
  },
  "triggersByIntegration": {
    "greenhouse": {
      "triggers": [
        { "key": "new_candidate", "label": "New Candidate Added" }
      ]
    },
    ...
  }
}

🛠 How Plan Management Works

👇 Flow:
1. Admin selects integrations (e.g., Gmail, Greenhouse).
2. Triggers & Actions are filtered and shown only for selected integrations.
3. Admin selects desired triggers/actions and saves them as part of the plan.

✅ Save Payload Example:
{
  "name": "Pro Plan",
  "integrations": ["Gmail", "Greenhouse"],
  "allowedTriggers": ["new_email_received", "new_candidate"],
  "allowedActions": ["send_email", "create_candidate"]
}

🧠 Client-Side Logic (Workflow Builder)

When the client opens their workflow builder:
1. Load their plan: allowedIntegrations, allowedTriggers, allowedActions
2. Check which integrations are actually connected by the user
3. Only show:
   - Triggers that match both allowedTriggers and a connected integration
   - Actions that match both allowedActions and a connected integration

🧪 Testing Plan Builder

To verify it works:
- Create a plan with one integration (e.g., Gmail)
- Add triggers and actions only for Gmail
- Save the plan
- Confirm client UI only shows Gmail items once it’s connected
